# Leetcode-3342.-Find-Minimum-Time-to-Reach-Last-Room-II

üöÄ Min Time To Reach (Dijkstra Variant on Grid with Move Parity)
üß† Problem Description
You are given a 2D grid where each cell contains a time value. Starting from cell (0, 0), you must reach cell (m-1, n-1). You can move in four directions (up, down, left, right), and your cost to move depends on:

Whether the current time is sufficient to enter the next cell.

A parity switch that adds an extra unit time every alternate move.

---

üìå Approach
This problem is solved using a modified Dijkstra's algorithm:

We use a min-heap priority queue to always expand the cell with the lowest current cost.

We track whether the current move is even or odd using a boolean flag move, which flips after every step.

The cost is computed by waiting if needed (max(0, grid[newi][newj] - cost)) and includes a penalty of +1 for time to move and +(move == 1) to simulate alternating behavior.

üì¶ Data Structures Used

visited[i][j]: Stores the minimum time required to reach cell (i, j).

Priority queue (min-heap) with elements of the form:
((cost, move_parity), (i, j))

---

‚è±Ô∏è Time Complexity
O(m √ó n √ó log(m √ó n))

Each cell is processed once at minimal cost.

Each operation in the priority queue takes log(m √ó n) time.

There are m √ó n cells in total.

---

üì¶ Space Complexity
O(m √ó n)

For the visited matrix.

For storing elements in the priority queue.
